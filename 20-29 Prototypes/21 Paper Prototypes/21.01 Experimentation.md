___
This one is a portable phone with two displays. Allowing you to separate the AI's comments from the user's input.

___
This device still has two displays, but its shape is inspired by the portable 1977 Radioshack TRS-80.
Although the keyboard looks like any regular keyboard, it does have a button that houses a heart-rate sensor, allowing the machine to feel the user's demeanour.

___
This device has a keyboard, but also two displays. One for each eye. The left one displays your content while you type, and the right display shows an assistant commenting on your writing.

___
This device has the looks of early PDAs docked on business people's desks. It is meant to be a companion to (or escape from) your office work. You can write, and the small display at the top shows a companion pet that reacts to your writing.

___
This device, as portable as it looks like, is about blind writing and getting reactions from the AI as you type. The AI here consists of a pet that you feed with your writing (ofc, it has to make sense!).
