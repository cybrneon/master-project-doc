# Thinking of the weather states

### Daytime & Nighttime weather states

- Clear Sunny (Bright, light rays, bird chirps, paper yellowing)
- Mostly Sunny (Soft diffused light, small clouds here and there, bird chirps)
- Partly Cloudy (Sunny with clouds)
- Clear (Soft diffused light)
- Cloudy (Clouds only)
- Foggy (Reduced visibility, clouds everywhere blured)
- Windy (Clouds everywhere moving fast)
- Light Rain (Gentle raindrops on the screen, calming rain drops sounds)
- Heavy Rain (Dark ambiance, steaming screen, water drops all over the screen, louder rainfall sounds)
- Thunderstorm (Occasional lightning flashes, thunder rumbles, heavy rain)
- Snowy (Gentle snowflakes falling, muffled sounds)
