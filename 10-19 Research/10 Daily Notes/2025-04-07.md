# Small talk with Pablo

I need to think about engagement, gamification that needs to be super pushed.
I need to test with people how I can take notes.
Context, how I can quickly take down notes, how it implies a behavior, how to make it interesting rather than a gimmick.
See gamified applications, sport, smoking, language learning, eating, customisation of characters, statistics.
Imagining a product, what problem am I solving? And how?
Why do you need an intimate journal? and what does it solve? How do I make it engaging?
What's the pain its trying to solve? The pain needs to be the biggest and the worse.
The cat character is good, but it has to be precise, mechanisms can go through the cat.
Check social media/smartphone addictions and psychological pains for example.

### The Pain
Writing is something that we don't usually do because we either loose interest in keeping it a habit after a few days, or we find it dumb and not useful.

### The Solution
Providing a gamified portable diary device that encourages self expression through note taking.
