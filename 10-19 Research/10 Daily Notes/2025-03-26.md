# Mid-Crit Presentation Feedback
**With Douglas and Pablo.**
"Why am I doing this?" This was Pablo's "boom" question.
This is the most important question I need to answer.
Even though I said exactly what I wrote in the [project's concept](../../00-09%20Resources/01%20About/01.02%20Project%20Concept.md) page, it doesn't really fit with my current (many) paper prototypes.
Pable then asked if I even had a private diary, and I said no. But that was a great question because I've always wanted to have one, and I even tried so many times but failed to keep up with the routine or the flow. That's why I'm thinking of making a dedicated device with an agent/ai/character that will foster writing and keeping a private diary.
And that's when Douglas jumped to say that it's exactly what I need to prototype. They both said that having sliders like this doesn't work, Douglas even hinted at having a horizontal slider at the top of the keyboard that will control the AI's bullshit/toxic positivity output.
Going in a speculative design/critical design is not a bad thing. Douglas also hinted at the NYTimes's podcast about people having intimate relationships with ChatGPT.
So, there is definitely the potential of going in the speculative design/critical design way.
I may need to start an intimate journal, as suggested by Pablo, but I don't know if it will be useful at the moment.
I've been struggling with so many health problems like depression and anxiety and I'm in the long process of healing and going to therapy for. Things have been super complicated since 2024 and I've gone through a lot; griefing of family members and friends passing away (and my sweet dog recently put down due to illness) to past child trauma catching up with adult me. And I remember starting a private diary in early 2024 but only went a week with it until I was tired of it, in part because it was triggering.
I don't want to make this project that personal, but it kind of is indirectly.
This is going to be great night.
