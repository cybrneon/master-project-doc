# Brainstorming with the colleagues

### The Prototypes
##### Weather Wordpad
1. Place a blank paper template with a weather icon legend in front of the subject
2. This is a notepad that responds to emotional content with weather effects
3. Give them a topic to take notes on (e.g., "Your thoughts on social media")
4. As they write, you manually add weather elements:
   - For positive content: Sun
   - For neutral content: Clouds
   - For negative content: Rain droplets
   - For passionate/intense content: Lightning bolt
5. After 5 minutes, ask them to review their notes and observe if they notice patterns
6. Interview questions:
   - "How did seeing the weather reactions influence what you wrote?"
   - "Did you notice yourself writing differently to trigger certain weather?"
   - "Would this help you identify emotional patterns in your thinking?"

##### Local/Online Notes
1. Give the subject two different coloured papers (e.g., blue for "online/shareable", yellow for "local/private")
2. Explain: "The blue paper represents notes that would be automatically shared with relevant people. The yellow paper is for private thoughts only."
3. Present a scenario: "You're in a class learning about a topic that relates to a personal experience"
4. Ask them to take notes, choosing which paper to use for each piece of information
5. After they write, ask them to explain their choices
6. Interview questions:
   - "What made you decide something belonged in private vs. shared notes?"
   - "Did having this distinction change what you chose to record?"
   - "Would this separation be useful in your regular note-taking?"
