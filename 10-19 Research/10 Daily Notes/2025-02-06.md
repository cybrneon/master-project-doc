# Talking with Dominic Robson, my tutor


create a map of different possibilities of this idea.
how does ai work, build a picture of this device
don't be too careful and too controlled.
it's about developing different things, map out the space of opportunities
develop the thinking, using as an exercise, give myself a headspace
think of how it could work on a traditional device, how would clippy if he came back would be
develop it and document it, storybording, sketches, paper prototypes,
think about the functionalities, the interaction, the form, how AI works with it.

the way we work with laptops, is incredibly disruptive, writers.
find new ways to take notes, write and document them!

make a brief for myself of what I write/note/document, a process.
