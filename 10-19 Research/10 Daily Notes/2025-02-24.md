### The Prototypes
##### Weather Wordpad
(This prototype can also happen on a computer with a keyboard)
1. Place a blank paper template with a weather icon legend in front of the subject
2. "This is a notepad that responds to emotional content with weather effects"
3. Give them a topic to take notes on (e.g., "Your thoughts on social media")
4. As they write, you manually add weather elements:
   - For positive content: Sun
   - For neutral content: Clouds
   - For negative content: Rain droplets
   - For passionate/intense content: Lightning bolt
5. After 5 minutes, ask them to review their notes and observe if they notice patterns
6. Interview questions:
   - "How did seeing the weather reactions influence what you wrote?"
   - "Did you notice yourself writing differently to trigger certain weather?"
   - "Would this help you identify emotional patterns in your thinking?"

##### Local/Online Notes
1. Give the subject two different coloured papers (e.g., blue for "online/shareable", yellow for "local/private")
2. "The blue paper represents notes that would be automatically shared with relevant people. The yellow paper is for private thoughts only."
3. Present a scenario: "You're in a class learning about a topic that relates to a personal experience"
4. Ask them to take notes, choosing which paper to use for each piece of information
5. After they write, ask them to explain their choices
6. Interview questions:
   - "What made you decide something belonged in private vs. shared notes?"
   - "Did having this distinction change what you chose to record?"
   - "Would this separation be useful in your regular note-taking?"

##### AI Writing/Reflective Assistant
1. Prepare a sheet of paper and place it in front of the subject
2. "This journal has an AI assistant that occasionally offers gentle reflections on what you write"
3. Ask them to write about their day or a recent experience for 2 minutes
4. After they write a few sentences, play the role of the AI by writing small, brief comments in the margins such as:
   - "I notice this brings you joy..."
   - "This seemed challenging for you..."
   - "I sense a connection to what you wrote earlier about..."
   - "Perhaps this relates to your interest in..."
5. Keep comments brief, non-judgmental, and observational rather than directive
6. After 5 minutes of this back-and-forth, ask them to reflect on the experience
7. Interview questions:
   - "How did it feel to have an AI notice patterns in your writing?"
   - "Did the comments influence what or how you wrote next?"
   - "Were there moments when the AI's observations felt helpful or intrusive?"
   - "Would this kind of subtle companion change how you journal compared to writing alone?"


###### Observational Comments:
- "I notice you mentioned this twice today..."
- "This seems important to you."
- "Your tone shifted here."
- "This connects to what you wrote yesterday about..."
- "You used more vivid language describing this moment."

###### Emotional Recognition:
- "This memory seems to bring you joy."
- "I sense some uncertainty here."
- "There's a warmth in how you describe this."
- "This appears to be a source of tension for you."
- "You seem energized when discussing this topic."

###### Pattern Noticing:
- "This theme has appeared in several entries now."
- "You often write about this after difficult days."
- "Your writing becomes more detailed when discussing this subject."
- "This contrasts with your perspective last week."
- "You've been circling this idea for some time."

###### Gentle Prompts:
- "I wonder what happened next..."
- "There might be more to explore here."
- "This feels connected to your earlier thoughts on..."
- "Perhaps this relates to your question from yesterday."
- "This seems like a new direction in your thinking."

###### Affirming Comments:
- "You've been consistent about this boundary."
- "Your perspective on this has evolved."
- "You're noticing nuances you didn't mention before."
- "This reflection shows your attention to detail."
- "You're making connections across different areas of your life."
