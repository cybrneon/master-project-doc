# Project Concept

### Intension
##### Description
The DayDreamer is a personal computer that acts as a private diary, accompanied by a subtle companion that grows with your thoughts. Capture ideas, feelings, and experiences in a space free from notifications, apps, or conventional organisational structures. Your companion quietly learns your reflection patterns, offering gentle guidance when needed and remaining unobtrusive when not.
##### Context
We live in a complex and fragmented world where attention is perpetually divided. The DayDreamer offers a safe and straightforward environment for focused reflection and note taking, with a companion that evolves based on your unique thought processes rather than external algorithms.
##### Audience
Young Adults who may use the diary form to express thoughts, feelings and experiences. For some, it's about relieving stress, considering our current tough times.

### The AI
"This small space voyager crashed into your DayDreamer after drifting through countless galaxies. It lost its star family and now observes your thoughts with an alien curiosity, gradually learning human emotions through your reflections. Though it communicates in primitive animations, you sense there's an intelligent presence behind its starry eyesâ€”a being that chose you as its guardian in the new world of human consciousness."

### Interaction
Users type on the device's keyboard to write texts. And while the knob allows allows navigation through the user interface, it also allows the selection of different AI modes.
