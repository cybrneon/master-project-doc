# Talking with my tutor

I need to come back into AI, and not loose all the work and research I've done.
People using AI to share intimate stuff with. For the final project, the AI can be faked.
The AI idea is still interesting and can be a bit critique, without intending it to be.
It could be like, the user can talk to its inner self.

To help myself, I need to imagine a movie.
