# Today's restructuration

Okay, so the best way to go with this is to go with my project is to critique.
I want to critique how people feed the AIs with their information. And what a better way to by having a device that eats your data and appears as cute as a cat.
A project questioning our dependence over the machines, but also how data like that can be used against us.

### Talking with Pablo
I need to find the thing that will keep the user hooked
I should think of the end and then get my way up to see the different steps to take.
what do i need to hear and understand from digital twin in the end.
how to get the user to input these things
how to use all these addiction mechanisms
worldbuilding (context, narration, something bigger that scams everyone)
what do they do with the stuff
why it's dangerous
the review, how it turns out in the end
how do I get from the dark part to now, start from the end and work my way up
what focus do I want to show
specify the output and the experience that will result
at the end there has to be a fake fireworks display that surprises people
choose the axis!

if it's free, you're the product
a camera that sees the user and offers subtle comments on his appearance
Emotional numbing
