# Getting Ready for the presentation
### Intension  
The DayDreamer is a private diary designed to free users from the distractions and limitations of conventional desktop interfaces. Capture thoughts, feelings, and experiences without the interruptions of notifications, apps, or conventional organizational structures.

### Context  
In our fragmented digital landscape where attention is perpetually divided, the DayDreamer offers a safe environment for focused reflection and note-taking.

### Audience  
Young Adults who may use the diary form to express thoughts, feelings and experiences.

### Main Topic  
My project explores how ambient AI can enhance personal reflection through gentle observation rather than intervention. The device investigates the potential for technology to act as a thoughtful witness to our inner lives, by noticing patterns and emotional shifts that might otherwise remain invisible.  
  
The DayDreamer journal is a responsive companion that reflects rather than directs, questioning whether subtle AI presence can augment self-awareness without sacrificing the personal, non-linear nature of note-taking and documentation.
