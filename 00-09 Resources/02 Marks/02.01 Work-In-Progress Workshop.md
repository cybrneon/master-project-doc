**Project: Reinventing the desktop - reGenesis**
Grade: **5.0**

An interesting and ambitious start thinking about reinventing our computer based interactions. Using ready made objects was a quick way to start these explorations and gave us a new way to think about how computers actually work. The weather based experiment did suggest new possibilities but clearly underlined that to move forward you need to be more clear about where your focus is. Our interactions around computing are based on metaphors and these all work to a particular context, content, hardware platforms etc. So its really important not to try and do everything and find an interesting space (an application, context) to concentrate your investigations. Think about the criteria you want to work to: playfulness, productivity, accessibility etc.
