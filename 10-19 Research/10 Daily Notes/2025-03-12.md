# Thinking and establishing the concept

In order to be clear on what I want to do, I need to start by imagining scenarios.

## Scenarios
#### Scenario 1
Sarah keeps her DayDreamer next to her bed.
When she wakes up, the small device displays a pulsing cloud icon.
She taps it and the device asks her to describe her dream in just three sentences.
When she types, the device's AI creates a visual representation of her dream as a small living entity that grows and changes throughout the day.

#### Scenario 2
Mark is in therapy working through anxiety.
His DayDreamer device has a cat-like avatar that responds to his emotional state.
When Mark is stressed, the cat appear agitated. Mark can write to the cat and the cat will respond by text.

#### Scenario 3
A small baby alien just fell from space, sadly, he fell inside of a computer and is trapped, forever.
The alien will grow with you, as you write.

#### Scenario 4
Amelia is a novelist who wants zero distractions.
She sets her DayDreamer to "OFF" mode and uses it purely as a focused writing tool.
The device functions as a simple digital typewriter with excellent keyboard feel and eye-friendly display.
After finishing her draft, she might turn the AI to "LOW" just to help organize her chapters, but she makes all creative decisions herself.

#### Scenario 5
John keeps his AI setting on "MEDIUM".
When working on complex research projects, he occasionally asks the AI to find connections between concepts he's exploring.
The AI doesn't generate new content but helps him see patterns in her own thinking.
He treats the AI as a thinking partner that helps him organize and connect his own ideas rather than creating content for him.

#### Key Design Principles
With transparency in mind, users can slowly increase AI involvement as comfort grows, by using the rotating wheel (not something buried in menus).

#### Other ideas
I need depth
Texts that draws stuff
Elevate
The device projects stuff based on what you're writing, personalized moodring, mirror to your soul, 
it's not about designing an experience that feels like siri, but like a worn and used notebook.
