- John starts writing with the keyboard, as characters and words magically appear on the display.
- "Dear diary, last night's sleep was quite good.
  Although I had heat problems and woke up sweating like crazy.
  Otherwise I slept like a goat."
- device: "A goat, huh? Thatâ€™s an interesting way to put it! Do you usually have trouble sleeping, or was last night just a weird one?" ![](../../00-09%20Resources/09%20Assets/Screenshot%202025-04-01%20at%2011.06.24.png)

### Scenario 2

- As she approaches, the device opens a new note displaying a blinking cursor.
- "Today was overwhelming. The project deadline got moved up, and now I'm questioning if I even want this promotion. The stress doesn't seem worth it anymore."
- device: "I notice you've been mentioning work pressure more frequently this month. Would you like to explore what parts of your job still bring you joy?"
- Athena reflects on this and continues writing. When she finishes, her companion says: "I've gathered these moments of pride from your past entries," displaying three tiny fragments from previous entries where she had expressed accomplishment.
