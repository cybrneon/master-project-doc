# Talking with my tutor

what is the interaction I have with this special device?

Have conversations, interactions with my device, there's still a definition of what my device is bringing.

There is something really interesting in the "talking to yourself", It's really interesting when its starting to mix up.

What's nice about the weather is that I'm doing it in a way that is not as direct as text.

What can I do:
- Talking to the thing, Trying different things
- Writing a diary, what things can be useful, interesting and working.
- What could work for me in these
- "I'm gonna create something for myself"
- What would I want? What changes the connection in a device of that way?
- Take it further, can I start to give a different kind of sense.
- Generate so many ideas as I can, in half an hour for ex.

Love Holten, mysterious devices, really cool. So my project needs to find a space/environment to fit in.

For a viewer, we need to be taken further, given the idea of how the interaction could play out.

Object, Interface, Interaction

Take people on a Story
Bring people to something we can understand, instead of something that is just "replacing a laptop".

For the diary thing, let's say I set a routine for every morning at 7:30 to write how I'm feeling, for 5 minutes (the minimum time for journaling).
