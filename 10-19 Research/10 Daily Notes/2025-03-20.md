# Speaking with my tutor before the Mid-Crit

Scenarios!!!
Will help explore the design, the interaction, the people...
Imagine people using it, will help grasp the possible interactions.
How would the tamagotchi work? Is it controlling all of the AI? is it only working as an agent?
Eating data? Then it becomes bigger for example. Find how the agent works?
Clarifying the tamagotchi x device mix.
How do people read it, how do people understand it?
With the scenarios, I should think about the functionality, the strange situations the might occur, ...
I can storyboard them in drawing! in figma! or in video!
The next step would be to look at different tools to prototype.
