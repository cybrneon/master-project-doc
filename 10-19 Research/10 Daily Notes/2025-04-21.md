# Going back a bit

Low distraction device with weather and time reactions to what users are writing.

Could be software only, but can also be a dedicated device that reconnects us to nature in a way?

*This was an experiment from the first crit where people were writing about their day, and I was acting as the AI changing the weather on their "desktop".*

The "AI" is the weather reaction, providing an augmented writing experience.
With every note created, a unique weather is happening in it, and you can control it with what you write.

The Weather can not only be visual, but sound can also work really well.

There was also this idea of having files get old if you don't open them often, as we do with notes, so they get dusty and grey. So notes could get yellowy when they're exposed to too much sun, notes could get wet if there's too much rain, etc.

### So, what am I trying to solve here?
- **Emotional disconnection in digital note taking:** current note taking apps feel sterile compared to the analog physical notebooks experience with their tactile qualities and personalisation.
- **Context and mood preservation:** current note taking apps don't capture the emotional context of when notes were created, which can be crucial for memory retention and meaning.
- **Engagement and focus issues**
- **Lack of environmental feedback:** Unlike physical environments that naturally respond to our presence, digital spaces often feel static and unresponsive.

**Here are quick Figma designs:**

### Storyboard
If it's a standalone device, I see it better in a desk at home environment. Something that you can use. I believe that it's probably too much to experience the thing on a phone because of how distracting it could be. And if it's not a standalone device, it's an app that runs on your computer.
