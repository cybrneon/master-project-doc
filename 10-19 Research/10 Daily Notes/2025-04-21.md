# Going back a bit

Low distraction device with weather and time reactions to what users are writing.

Could be software only, but can also be a dedicated device that reconnects us to nature in a way?

*This was an experiment from the first crit where people were writing about their day, and I was acting as the AI changing the weather on their "desktop".*

The "AI" is the weather reaction, providing an augmented writing experience.
With every note created, a unique weather is happening in it, and you can control it with what you write.

The Weather can not only be visual, but sound can also work really well.

### So, what am I trying to solve here?
- **Emotional disconnection in digital note taking:** current note taking apps feel sterile compared to the analog physical notebooks experience with their tactile qualities and personalisation.
- **Context and mood preservation:** current note taking apps don't capture the emotional context of when notes were created, which can be crucial for memory retention and meaning.
- **Engagement and focus issues**
- **Lack of environmental feedback:** Unlike physical environments that naturally respond to our presence, digital spaces often feel static and unresponsive.

**Here are quick Figma designs:**
