# Thinking of the weather states

### Daytime & Nighttime weather states
- Heat Wave (subtle heat distortion effects, cicada sounds, paper yellowing really fast)
- Clear Sunny (Bright, light rays, bird chirps, paper yellowing)
- Mostly Sunny (Soft diffused light, small clouds here and there, bird chirps)
- Partly Cloudy (Sunny with clouds)
- Clear (Soft diffused light)
- Cloudy (Clouds only)
- Foggy (Reduced visibility, clouds everywhere blured)
- Windy (Clouds everywhere moving fast)
- Light Rain (Gentle raindrops on the screen, calming rain drops sounds)
- Heavy Rain (Dark ambiance, steaming screen, water drops all over the screen, louder rainfall sounds)
- Thunderstorm (Occasional lightning flashes, thunder rumbles, heavy rain)
- Snowy (Gentle snowflakes falling, muffled sounds)

### Further Thinking
Testing the interactive experience with testers, they mentioned that having an augmented weather system can also be physical.

But the main thing is that they had the impression that they were talking to someone, seeing how the "AI" reacted (they didn't know their words changed the weather in the beginning).

Also, having a routine is probably a good thing, so the device becomes a household appliance in a way.
