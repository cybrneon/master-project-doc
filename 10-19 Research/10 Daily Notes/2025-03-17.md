### Intension
The DayDreamer is a personal computer that acts as a private diary, accompanied by a subtle companion that grows with your thoughts. Capture ideas, feelings, and experiences in a space free from notifications, apps, or conventional organizational structures. Your companion quietly learns your reflection patterns, offering gentle guidance when needed and remaining unobtrusive when not.

### Context
We live in a complex and fragmented world where attention is perpetually divided. The DayDreamer offers a safe and straightforward environment for focused reflection and note taking, with a companion that evolves based on your unique thought processes rather than external algorithms.

### Audience
Young Adults who are looking to expand their frontal lobe instead of getting a lobotomy.
