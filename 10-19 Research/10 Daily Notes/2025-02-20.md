Thinking through making
crazy note takers
what do you need to take notes on how how, depends on the situation you're in
think broadly
thinking about why you're kind of working down
note taking is writing down and putting down information
the important thing I'm doing really, we're dealing with so much information
finding ways to cope with ways to filter, crazy ways of information
how do I organize all the information I need to know
what are the different ways I could be dealing with information
give myself some tasks; go and write down stuff, small/dumb/ridiculous tasks
writing/taking notes while people are talking/doing stuff, in the process, writing the summary or what people are saying
there are systems in the UK; shorthand
lots of people have spent time on note problem (apple newton, palm pilot, ...)
do these challenges, what do I bring, how do we move forward.
I need to find good ways, if I can do interfaces let's do, speculate on interfaces.
speculative design interfaces, have to be ridiculous!!!!!
create a series of different versions, 5 minimum. Play around with the things I'm interested in.
the important thing to do, quick start, speculative devices, give a sense of how it works. Tell a story of how a story works. Let my self go really broad, they don't need to make sense.
It the same time, challenge myself different situations to take notes, I can also ask people how they take notes.
