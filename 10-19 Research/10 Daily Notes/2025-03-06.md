# Keep Prototyping

How much is it about building a kind of a different kind of relationship with AI and technology.
Thinking about the more global range of actions and relationship with the device.
Don't worry if its a bit messy. A different kind of device.
Checkout affective computing!
Thinking about something that I'm gonna find interesting.
The eyes think looks interesting because people don't understand it. It's about having power on what's gonna be the most people's attention grabbing.
I'm in a great position to do something different.
Explore different kinds of computing devices, what would both devices be like with AI, what if we design stuff with AI.
Create some type of prototype/action, playfull, something that changes the way we work with devices.
I can make a collection /family of devices that are linked together. I can create one product only.
Change the way people see the possibilities.
The device with the two eyes, is good.
Play with the expectations of HCI. Think of new forms, give myself freedoms (many).
