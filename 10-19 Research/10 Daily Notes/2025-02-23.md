# Time to get to work

### Some key themes
- Context-aware creation
- Information challenge overload
- Crazy ideas
- Pushing existing ideas? (shorthand - stenography - for note taking for ex.)
- Hands-on experimentation

### Ideas
- Transcribing bird/plane flight patterns into text
- Converting bus traffic into a daily journal
- Puddle ripples as a form of stenography
- Converting pulse into morse code notes
- Notes that can be read only at the time they were created.

Conclusion: These ideas are too simple and boring.

### Better ideas
- Memory fog notes, where you write on windows/glass and they only appear when you breathe on them.
- Emotional weather system, where each "room" or "desktop" has a different weather condition.
- Dream Collector Machine, writing and collecting dreams each morning.
- Cloud-based notes
- Pigeon Meetings, where each pigeon landing somewhere creates a note-taking point, with the number of pigeons increasing the importance of notes

I like the dream collector machine.
