# Productive Day
## Brainstorming with Pierre Rossel

The idea of having a restricting device is nice but will people use it if they have the choice between a regular laptop and the DayDreamer?
I really need to think of the project's goal and why it's unique. And that could be with AI.

## Talking with Dominic
- Scenarios for the tamagotchis.
- Pushing current prototypes further and imagining how the AI work.
