# New Storyboard

![](../../00-09%20Resources/09%20Assets/Storyboarding%201.jpg)
1. Every morning/every evening, the user approaches the Clarity MK-01 device.
2. They immediately start typing into the keyboard and text starts appearing on the left screen.
3. While the user types, the right screen displays weather effects, generated in real time of what the user is typing.
4. The user keeps writing and seeing their live weather.
5. When the user finishes, they get a closing and encouraging message, before closing the note.
6. They can also revisit older notes and see how thoughts evolved, while also reliving the weather.
7. The user leaves and comes back the next day.

# Insights from journaling
- Having a timer is great because it allows the user to easily plan it in their daily routine.
- Journaling is about writing and emotions at the same time, but when people go back to their older notes, they don't really feel what was written, and words kind of become sterile (if they're writing on an app).
- When the user is writing, it would be interesting to hide previously written paragraphs in the current note, so that people don't focus on re-reading their texts, changing words or even the wordcount.

# Talk with tutor.
I need to find ways to make people really want to take notes.
No gamification, but creative processes, writing style,...
Personal expression.
Develop storyboard from 3. to 5.
Start imagining, think of interfaces, things moving from one to the other ... See what's possible with these two screens, experiment. Be playful, what kind of play I can have with that. Iterate!
Take the idea and be more pushy with it, and be clearer about the journaling experience.
