# The Reframing

Okay.

Last crit was super hard. I almost felt like all my thinking was for nothing.

Two days later, here I am, in front of my computer, on Friday night.

Wondering how I'll pull this off.

Looking back to my old prototypes, I feel like we could have something.

But I'll need to answer the question of "What am I trying to solve?"
