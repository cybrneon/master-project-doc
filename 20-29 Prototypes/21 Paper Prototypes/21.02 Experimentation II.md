Here's another device that resembles the TRS-80, but has a dial on the right that allows the user to select the level of interaction with the AI.
There are so many ways of using this dial like:
- Use it to navigate the computer's UI (just like the Apple Watch's crown dial).
- Use it to select a current mood (happy, sad, angry, ...)

Here's a variant with a tilted screen, a bigger dial. Another addition is the Fine Tuner device on the left, that allows users to fine tune the AI to their mood.
The Fine Tuner module can attach to the computer and be removed when not needed (modular?).

Here's one example I tested on people using OpenAI's ChatGPT (in French):

Here's another variant of the computer, with two displays. Again with this idea of using one to display the user's content, and the other to display the AI output.

This time, it's portable!

Going from the idea of the modular Fine Tuner, here's another module that has a dial only. Allowing either the selection of moods, but can also be fine tuned.
