So, I was thinking of a personal writing device that people can use only for writing, stripping away the desktop metaphor for a more calm and chill digital interface that removes distractions.

The writing interface responds visually to rhythm and emotion. The interface could also reflect thinking patterns with the content organising in a 3D space.

The interface could also respond to the environment and physical location (time & weather for example), allowing a connection to the real world enabling a window to the real world.

What if I could add AI to the project? A writing assistant?
